## Motor-PWM

-----

This repository is destined to develop my Embedded Systems homework with [rgapski](https://github.com/rgapski/).

The purpose of these homework is control a PWM motor with the **Tiva-C Series TM4C123G** and show in a 7-segment display the motor's velocity. Beyond this, the project is able to control the direction of the motor.
